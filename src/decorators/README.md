# app/src/decorators

### Purpose

This folder contains files that are intended to wrap (or decorate) components in your
application. Common examples include fetching data (like lore.connect), redirecting the
user to a login page if they aren't authenticated, or hiding components the user doesn't
have permission to interact with.
